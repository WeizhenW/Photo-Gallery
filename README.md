# Gallery of My Life

This is a photo gallery app with which user can add, delete, favor a photo, or click to flip a photo to see the description.

### Setup

There is no database component to base mode. All data is stored in an array on the server. 

Running the server code requires `nodemon`. If you don't already have `nodemon`, install it globally with `npm install nodemon --global`.

```
npm install
npm run server
```

Now that the server is running, open a new terminal tab with `cmd + t` and start the react client app.

```
npm run client
```
